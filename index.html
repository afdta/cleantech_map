	<h1>Patenting invention: Clean energy innovation trends and priorities for the Trump administration and Congress</h1>

	<p>At a moment when the Trump administration has proposed draconian budget cuts, signs indicate that United States clean energy innovation could be lagging. The looming budget cuts raise concerns about the future of the nation’s long-term commitment to low-carbon economic development.</p>

	<p>Clean energy innovation holds immense potential to spark job creation in U.S. regions, support the manufacturing sector, and make the U.S. more competitive internationally. However, several indicators of U.S. cleantech innovation competitiveness are raising red flags. Eleven countries around the world now spend more on energy research and development (R&amp;D) as a percentage of their economies than the United States does; China spends three times as much.[1]</p>

	<p>As Congress considers the Trump budget proposals and develops its own plan, it is appropriate to assess the status of the U.S. cleantech innovation enterprise, both nationally and regionally. To that end, this brief and a forthcoming one look closely at trends and issues involving two key aspects of U.S. cleantech innovation—technology patenting and VC investment—as they are playing out across 14 clean technology areas and the nation’s diverse metropolitan areas.</p>

	<p>Patenting matters, because patenting—a measure of new technology invention—is an intermediate step toward innovation, and patent data provide indirect and partial indicators of innovation. Patenting activity has showed a positive correlation with regional economic health, as high rates of patent creation are geographically associated with higher-than-average wages, lower regional unemployment, and more startup company activities.</p>

	<p class="section-header">U.S. cleantech patenting has grown significantly since 2001, outpacing growth in all U.S. patents, but may now be flagging</p>

	<p>Patent filing and granting has generally increased in the 2000s, and the cleantech sector is no exception.[2] Since 2001, the total number of granted patents in cleantech has more than doubled—from a little less than 15,000 in 2001 to approximately 32,000 in 2016. Moreover, patenting in cleantech has been growing faster than in many other important innovation industries. During 2001–2014, for example, cleantech patenting grew at a 7 percent annual rate&mdash;faster than patenting in such celebrated innovation industries as medical technology (which grew at 6 percent annually), semiconductors (5 percent), biotechnology (3 percent), and pharmaceuticals (4 percent). Only digital communications and computer technology (14 percent and 12 percent a year growth) saw faster patenting than cleantech.</p>

	<p>However, between 2014 and 2016 the number of cleantech patents granted in the country has declined by 9 percent (Figure 1). The decline has been most pronounced in energy efficiency, hydro and marine power, solar, bioenergy, and nuclear. It is too early to say whether the downward trend is just a blip or here to stay. In 2015, for instance, overall patents granted by the USPTO decreased by 2 percent, the first decline in granted patents since 2008.iii But the recent overall slump bears watching.</p>

<div class="reading-box">
	<p class="section-header">Cleantech patenting is quite concentrated in relatively few categories</p>
	<p>While cleantech patenting appears vibrant and extensive in some technology areas, it remains modest in others (Figure 2). Overall, a total of 186,500 patents have been granted in the United States since 2011 across 14 cleantech categories. Of this activity, advanced green materials, energy efficiency, and transportation each accounted for 18 percent of the total patenting, while energy storage accounted for another 15 percent. This extensive activity reflects that these are broad categories encompassing a wide range of technologies addressing large sectors of the economy. Energy efficiency, for instance, includes technologies related to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); water heating; appliances; windows and building envelope; lighting; sensors and controls; and smart meters.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, little innovation has been occurring in other categories including hydro and nuclear which play a large role in U.S. energy production. The low patenting rate in the nuclear power industry is especially concerning. Without improved reactor technologies—advances yielding cost reductions, shorter cycle times, smaller sizes, and greater safety—nuclear power will be unable to play an expanded role as a source of zero-carbon power.ii Advances in wave and tidal power generation are also lagging behind despite their vast global potential to generate new sources of clean and renewable electricity.iii</p>

<div class="reading-box">
	<p>[SHOULD WE BREAK APART THE ABOVE GRAPHIC INTO SEPARATE CHARTS ON SIZE and GROWTH?]</p>
	<p>Patenting has picked up since 2011 in such categories as nuclear (albeit from a low base), geothermal, transportation, and water and wastewater. Most notably, while patenting in the nuclear power industry contracted 3 percent per year between 2001 to 2010, the industry has posted a solid 7 percent a year patenting surge (again, on a small base) since 2011. Apparently rising interest in nuclear energy is moving the industry toward innovation.i Similarly, the negligible patenting rates exhibited by the transportation and water/wastewater industries prior to the recession have given way to more respectable patenting rates of 4 percent and 3 percent CAGR since then. This bodes well.</p>
	<p>With that said, patenting is slowing in other categories. Patenting rates for wind and solar, for example, surged before the crisis but have slowed since 2011. Wind tech patenting, for instance, expanded by 25 percent a year between 2001 and 2010 but has been growing at a more modest 7 percent CAGR since then, perhaps reflecting the natural maturation of the industry. A similar slowdown has affected the solar and energy-efficiency industries.</p>

	<p class="section-header">Large metropolitan areas host a disproportionate share of cleantech patenting but do not monopolize it; overall, cleantech patenting is widely distributed across the nation</p>

	<p>Cleantech patenting, in terms of absolute patent issuance, is highly concentrated in a relatively small number of larger metropolitan areas. This is not surprising given that metropolitan areas are home to the productive drivers of the U.S. economy. Metros aggregate the productive assets—skilled workers, capital investment, advanced technologies, infrastructure, and relationship networks—that matter for economic growth and competitiveness. Indeed, the 100 largest metro areas, which are home to 35 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 73 percent of granted cleantech patents, developed by one or more U.S.-based inventors, since 2011.</p>

	<p class="section-header">The cleantech technology landscape varies depending on category and metro areas often display distinct patterns of patenting focus</p>
	<p>The goal of this interactive element is to take the user on a tour of the patenting categories to see how patenting within each category is distributed among metro areas and to see who the major players are.</p>
	<p>I've not enabled much functionality here yet. Likely, the bubble cloud will morph between categories as the user scrolls down the page and I will annotate each bubble cloud with the major metro players, important features of the distribution (e.g. it is dominated by one metro area), and/or smaller metro areas who make outsized contributions to the patenting category. This will replace the place-by-place discussion of the report.</p>
	<p>For now, you can toggle between the categories to get a sense for the differences between categories</p>

	<p class="section-header">The share of U.S. cleantech patents owned by foreign companies has grown over the years, raising concerns about the global competitiveness of U.S. companiesi</p>
	<p>Even while cleantech innovation holds out the promise of regional and national economic gain in the United States, cleantech patenting is increasingly being led by foreign companies. </p>
	<p>Specifically, foreign companies collectively have begun to capture a larger share of U.S. cleantech patents awarded to corporations over the years (Figure 5). In 2001, both U.S. and foreign-owned companies generated about 47 percent of cleantech patents each. By 2016, 51 percent of all cleantech patents were generated by large foreign multinationals, while only 39 percent were generated by U.S. companies .i Some of this may reflect foreign acquisitions of innovative U.S. companies by foreign ones, but in any event patent-quantity supremacy may be shifting away from corporate America to companies based overseas, especially in Asia.ii Such shifts could in time challenge the assumption that the United States is a global innovation leader in the cleantech sector.</p>
	<p>[GRAPHIC ON FOREIGN OWNERSHIP]</p>
	<p class="section-header">Conclusion</p>
	<p>So how should the nation and its regions respond to changing patenting trends and coming budget decisions in Congress? It is important to remember that the transition to a clean economy is well under way globally. China’s National Energy Administration recently announced that the country will invest $361 billion in renewable power generation alone by 2020, creating an additional 3 million jobs in the process.i The European Union has also pledged to stick to its environmental policies and climate targets—reducing emissions by at least 40 percent in 2030 from 1990 levels—regardless of what the United States does.ii</p>
